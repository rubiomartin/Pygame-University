## Pygame Game - University Project

This is a project I worked on with two classmates for a university assignment. The task involved developing the following functions, which can be found in the file `funcionesVACIAS.py`:

- `lectura`
- `nuevaPalabra`
- `silabasTOpalabra`
- `palabraTOsilaba`
- `esCorrecta`
- `puntaje`

We also added extra features like sounds and images. We received a grade of 10 (ten) for this work.
